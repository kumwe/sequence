 * it into one run per calendar period. That choice is visible in the number itself — the period segment
 * `NumberSequenceFormat` renders is what keeps `INV-2026-000001` and `INV-2027-000001` apart — so changing
 * it on a published definition changes what the numbers mean. `FiscalPeriod` steps outside the calendar
 * entirely: its period is whatever range the host declared over its posting timeline, so its key is resolved
 * by the host from the record's declared posting date rather than composed here.
